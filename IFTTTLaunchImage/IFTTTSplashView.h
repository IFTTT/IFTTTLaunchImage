/**
 *  A splash view that you can display when your app launches.
 *  When your app has finished launching and loading its initial interface, the splash
 *  view may be dismissed using one of several built-in animations.
 *
 *  The splash view has 3 modes of operation:
 *
 *  1) Launch image - this is the default mode. Invoke @c showSplash to display the splash
 *  view immediately using the launch image named 'LaunchImage' from your asset catalog.
 *  You may assign to the @c image property to use a different launch image on the splash screen,
 *  e.g. if your launch image in your asset catalog has a name other than 'LaunchImage'.
 *
 *  2) Launch Screen - if you are using a nib file for your Launch Screen, invoke
 *  @c showSplashWithNib:bundle: to display the splash view immediately using the nib name and bundle specified.
 *  This will assign the nib's view to the splash screen's @c customView property.
 *
 *  3) Custom View - you may use any custom view for the splash screen. Assign your view to the
 *  @c customView property, then invoke @c showSplash.
